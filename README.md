# Alfi Technical Test

Displaying real-time metrics for our devices' locations and statuses is a critical component of our reporting strategy. This allows us to provide accurate, live data to our clients.

Using Translink's JourneyPlanner API, implement an MVP in React for a real-time reporting dashboard. What exactly this consists of is up to you, but preferably it will include:
- A map component (or a *very* pretty table, lol)
- A way to locate/inspect stops
- A way to track buses
- Information about the routes available

As Translink's JourneyPlanner API is supposedly quite complex and undocumented (surprise surprise!) you may find this package useful: https://github.com/McPo/belfast-glider-api-server

This repository contains the map component and two endpoints to obtain Stop data.

Don't spend too much time on this (2-3 hours *max*). What we are looking for are core concepts, interesting ideas, and clean code.

For submission, Github is preferred (JSFiddle, Codepen, CodeSandbox etc are fine if you have trouble) - just send a link to conor@getalfi.com and lorenzo@getalfi.com when you're done (and remember to give us permissions!).

Good luck, and have fun!




## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
